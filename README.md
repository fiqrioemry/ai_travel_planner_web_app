# 🛍️ Travelo – AI Trip Planner Web App
Travelo is an AI-powered travel planning application that helps users create fully customized and intelligent travel itineraries in just seconds. Users can define their preferences—such as departure location, destination, duration, and budget—and Travelo will instantly generate a complete day-by-day plan including activities, transportation, hotel suggestions, and local travel tips.

Built using Gemini AI, Firebase, and the modern React ecosystem, Travelo simplifies the trip planning experience and turns it into an interactive, efficient, and enjoyable process.

## 1. Project Overview
The goal of Travelo is to eliminate the hassle and complexity of manually planning trips. Whether you're a solo traveler or a family on vacation, finding activities, coordinating hotel stays, and organizing schedules can be overwhelming and time-consuming.

Travelo addresses this by offering an intelligent, AI-assisted planning tool that generates personalized itineraries in real-time. The app captures user inputs through a guided step-by-step interface, processes them using Gemini AI, and presents structured travel recommendations instantly—empowering users with both flexibility and automation.

## 2. Project Requirements
- Build a user-friendly interface for creating and managing AI-generated travel itineraries

- Integrate AI (Gemini) to generate smart and relevant travel plans

- Authenticate users using Google Sign-In (Firebase Auth)

- Store user trips in a secure and scalable database (Firebase Firestore)

- Support city search and geolocation with external APIs (Geoapify)

- Provide smooth UX including dark mode, step-by-step flow, and responsive design

- Allow users to save, view, and delete trip plans easily

## 3. The Challenge
Creating an AI-driven travel planner involved balancing personalization and speed. The biggest challenge was ensuring accurate and engaging travel recommendations using user input, all within a few seconds. Furthermore, handling various integration points—AI prompt handling, API throttling, user session management, and real-time Firestore syncing—required a seamless data flow and robust architecture.

Another key concern was managing user expectations with AI output, and designing a UI that guides without overwhelming.

## 4. The Approach & Solution
To address these challenges, Travelo was built as a modular React app with TypeScript and Zustand for clean state management. A multi-step form captures trip preferences, which are passed to Gemini AI via a curated and structured prompt. The output is parsed into an interactive itinerary with hotel and activity suggestions.

User authentication and trip persistence are managed through Firebase Auth and Firestore, while Geoapify is used for flexible city lookup and location data. The interface uses Framer Motion for animations, TailwindCSS for responsive design, and Headless UI for accessible components.

Each trip is saved under the user’s account and can be deleted or revisited from the “My Trips” dashboard. Dark mode toggle and mobile optimization ensure the app is pleasant to use in any environment.
